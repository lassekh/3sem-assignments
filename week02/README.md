JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.

JSON follows JavaScript Object syntax and XML follows HTML syntax with nested elements. JSON is shorter, quicker to read and write, can use arrays and does not have end tags. Biggest difference is how you parse it.

JSON is used for storing and transporting data in a simple and readable way.

Data types: String, number, Object, array, boolean and null.

Data are always in name:value pairs. Data must be seperated by commas. Object are in curly brackets and arrays are in square brackets.
